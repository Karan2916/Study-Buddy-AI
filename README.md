## The Problem
BMSCE students manage dozens of PDFs, notes, and slides. When it's time to study, finding a specific piece of information is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Answers are buried across countless files, making revision inefficient and stressful.

## The Solution
Study Buddy AI transforms this scattered information into a centralized, intelligent knowledge base. This project leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide:

- **Instant Answers:** Ask a question in plain English and get a concise answer generated by an AI.
- **Cited Sources:** Every answer is backed by a citation with the exact page number from your documents.
- **Enhanced Learning:** The assistant also finds and suggests relevant YouTube videos to supplement your learning.

## ‚ú® Core Features
- **End-to-End RAG Pipeline:** Ingests PDF documents at runtime to create a searchable vector index using FAISS.
- **AI-Powered Q&A:** Uses Google's Gemini model to understand questions and synthesize answers from retrieved context.
- **Citations & Explainability:** Provides page-number citations for every answer, ensuring you can trust and verify the information.
- **Innovation & Personalization:** Features creative prompt engineering to act as a helpful BMSCE tutor and integrates a YouTube search tool for further learning.
- **Content Guardrails:** Implements safety settings to ensure appropriate handling of all queries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Running Locally
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (or Bun/Yarn)
- Python 3.10+ and pip
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karan2916/Study-Buddy-AI.git
cd Study-Buddy-AI
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the `backend` folder:
```bash
cd backend
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `.env` file: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your secret keys:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY="your_custom_search_api_key"
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your_search_engine_id"
```

### 3. Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create `.env` file: Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder and add the following line:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 4. Run the Application
You'll need two separate terminals running at the same time.

**Terminal 1 (Backend):** In the `backend` folder, run:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):** In the `frontend` folder, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL provided by Vite).

## üöÄ Deployment
This application is deployed on Render using a monorepo structure.
- The backend is deployed as a **Web Service**.
- The frontend is deployed as a **Static Site**.

Changes pushed to the `main` branch automatically trigger new deployments.
